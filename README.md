# Prediction Market

## 📌 Project Title:
**Prediction Market**

## 📄 Project Description:
Prediction Market is a decentralized application built using Ethereum smart contracts that allows users to bet on the outcome of real-world events. It works by collecting bets from users who predict whether a certain statement will be true or false. Once the outcome is determined, winners are rewarded proportionally from the pooled funds.

## 🎯 Project Vision:
To create a trustless, transparent, and decentralized platform where users can participate in prediction events without the need for intermediaries. The aim is to enable fair distribution of rewards and encourage crowdsourced forecasting.

## 💡 Key Features:
- ✅ Transparent betting system using blockchain
- 🧾 One-time betting per user to prevent spam
- 🔒 Owner-controlled market closure and result announcement
- 💰 Fair reward distribution to correct predictors
- 📊 View total number of bets and participation data

## 🚀 Future Scope:
- 📱 Frontend integration with React or Next.js
- 🧠 Oracle integration (e.g., Chainlink) for automatic result fetching
- 🧩 NFT-based reward systems for top predictors
- 📈 Multiple question support and dynamic markets
- 📲 Mobile DApp compatibility for wider adoption
